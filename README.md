# GP redirect

A very simple app to recieve requests on a single URL and forward those onto
the appropriate page in the [profiles app](https://github.com/nhsuk/profiles).

It is intended to work with requests from the NHS Choices site on the GP pages,
using the id of the GP surgery from the referrering page.
